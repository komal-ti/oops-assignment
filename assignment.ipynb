    "#ANS:Here’s a simplified explanation of the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Classes and Objects:  \n",
    "# Think of a class as a blueprint, like a cookie cutter. It defines what properties and actions the objects (like the cookies) will have. An object is an actual instance of that class, with its own specific values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2.Encapsulation:  \n",
    "#This is about keeping things bundled together and controlling access. Imagine a TV remote where you can only see and use certain buttons but don’t need to worry about the inner workings. Encapsulation hides the complex details, allowing you to interact with just what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Abstraction:  \n",
    "  # Similar to encapsulation, abstraction hides complex details but focuses on showing only the important parts. It’s like using a car without knowing how the engine works. You just know how to drive it, which makes it easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Inheritance:  \n",
    "  # - Inheritance is like passing down traits from parent to child. A child class gets characteristics from a parent class, so you don’t have to recreate everything from scratch. For example, a “Bird” class could have “Can Fly,” and the “Eagle” class, which inherits from “Bird,” would automatically have that trait.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Polymorphism:  \n",
    "   #- Polymorphism allows one action to be performed in different ways. It’s like pressing the “play” button on different devices (TV, phone, computer) and each one plays something but in its own way. It enables flexibility so that similar actions can adapt based on the context. \n",

    "1.Instance methods are methods that operate on individual instances of a class.\n",

    "Ans:Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is the order in which Python searches for methods in a class hierarchy, especially in cases of multiple inheritance. It ensures that Python looks through classes in a specific order to find the method, avoiding conflicts when classes have methods with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "How MRO Works:\n",
    "1.Python searches for a method in the current class, then in its parent classes, based on a well-defined order.\n",
